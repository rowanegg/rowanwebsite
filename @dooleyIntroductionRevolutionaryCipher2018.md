> - **Abstract:** Cryptology is the science of secret writing. It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writing and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them. Over the past 2500 years, cryptology has developed numerous types of systems to hide messages and subsequently a rich vocabulary in which to describe them. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the vocabulary of cryptology, explain the differences between codes and ciphers and begin the discussion of how to decipher an unknown message.

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> Substitution ciphers will replace each letter in a message with a different letter or symbol using a mapping called a cipher alphabet. The second type will rearrange the letters of a message, but will not substitute new letters for the existing letters in the message. These are transposition ciphers.
